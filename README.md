# Spotify Data Visualizer app
 App to visualize 100 most popular songs on Spotify from 2010-2019

Spotify visualization tool uses data about 100 most popular songs from each of 10 years (2010-
2019), in total 1000 popular songs. Tool can be used by anyone who is interested in music, artists
and genres, or wants to know how the trends changed over this one decade. It enables users to
explore what artists, genres and songs were popular and at which time. Users can analyze and
compare popular songs, their features, all artists or just certain artists types, individual genres or
whole genre groups or subgroups.

For every popular song, we have its features, main genre, release year and the year it was
most popular in. With over 100 unique genres, we have organized them into primary genre groups
and subgroups to make it easier for users to navigate and analyze popularity in terms of genres.
Also, each popular song has a type of an artist performing (solo, duo, trio or band) as well as itâ€™s
popularity score, which was used to measure popularity of songs, but we also used it for measuring
popularity of genres and artists.
